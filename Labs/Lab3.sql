/*
customer_id is a surrogate key that just gets sequentially assigned. We don't
care what the values are, just as long as they never change, and they are unique.
Which means that a DBMS constructed sequence is just about the perfect solution.
The syntax for the customer_id column is peculiar to Derby.To do the same thing in 
MySQL, the syntax would be: "customer_id int not null auto_increment,"Note that 
we still have to declare ths to be the primary key. Since it's the only attribute 
in the primary key, I can declare the primary key constraint "inline" rather than 
out of line. This is a handy shortcut that you will want to use if you have only 
one attribute (usually as surrogate) in the PK. Note also that we create the customers_uk01
uniqueness constraint to implement the candidate key over (cFirstname, cLastname, and cPhone).
